    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>4 slices of ham</li>
        <li>4 slices of Swiss cheese (Gruyère or other melting cheeses can also be used)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (Panko breadcrumbs work well for extra crispiness)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Additional herbs or spices like paprika, garlic powder, or thyme for seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter (for frying, if you choose to fry)</li>
        <li>Toothpicks (for securing the chicken rolls)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pound 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness between sheets of plastic wrap or in a ziplock bag.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of each chicken breast with salt, pepper, and any additional herbs or spices you prefer.</li>
        <li>Place a slice of Swiss cheese and then a slice of ham on each breast.</li>
        <li>Roll up each breast tightly and secure the ends with toothpicks.</li>
        <li>Set up three shallow dishes: one with 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, one with 2 beaten eggs, and one with 1 cup breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken roll in flour, dip in beaten egg, and coat with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>To Fry and Bake: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken rolls until golden brown on all sides, then transfer to a baking dish and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
        <li>To Bake Only: Place breaded rolls on a greased baking sheet and bake in preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or until golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove toothpicks, let the chicken rest for a few minutes, and serve. Optionally, serve with a sauce of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
